# Arti v1.1.2

"Hello World!"
This is repo is my attempt at making a virtual assistant. 'Arti' short for artificial inteligence, is inspired by marvel's 'Jarvis'. 

<h3>CREATOR NOTE</h3>  
Currently Arti is personalized for me, as it has certain functions I find useful. Yet the code is Open Source and can be modified for other users

Some commands Arti knows ===>   
search: searches web by opening a new tab or reads results directly from search     
news: displays latest news  
jokes/facts: can tell a random joke/fact  
personalized local db that tracks favorite shows, books etc.
