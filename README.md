# Arti v1.0

"Hello World!"
This is repo is my attempt at making a virtual assistant. 'Arti' short for artificial inteligence, is inspired by marvel's 'Jarvis'. 

# CREATOR NOTE 
Currently Arti is personalized for me, as it has certain functions I find useful. Yet the code is Open Source and can be modified for other users

Some commands Arti knows:   
time: to tell current time  
weather: to display weather of given city   
news: displays latest news
